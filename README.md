Keyboard-Maestro-Macros
=======================

I use Keyboard Maestro mostly as a launcher and try to do as much of the *work* with Bash and AppleScripts as I can. Most of the things that Keyboard Maestro does can be done with scripts. Keyboard Maestro is great for getting user input and for creating shortcuts and generating macro palettes.
